# Fastlane Sample Application - Quickstart
This sample app demonstrates how to integrate with Fastlane using PayPal's REST APIs.

## Before You Code
1. **Setup a PayPal Account**

    To get started, you'll need a developer, personal, or business account.

    [Sign Up](https://www.paypal.com/signin/client?flow=provisionUser) or [Log In](https://www.paypal.com/signin?returnUri=https%253A%252F%252Fdeveloper.paypal.com%252Fdashboard&intent=developer)

    You'll then need to visit the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/) to obtain credentials and to make sandbox accounts.

2. **Create an Application**

    Once you've setup a PayPal account, you'll need to obtain a **Client ID** and **Secret**. [Create a sandbox application](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/sandbox/create).

### Quick Start Integration

#### Overview
Fastlane Quick Start Integration uses PayPal's pre-built UI for payment collection, thereby allowing you to integrate quickly and easily. The Fastlane Payment Component will automatically render the following:
1. Customer's selected card and "Change" link which allows users to choose a different saved card or use a new card (for Fastlane members)
2. Credit card and billing address fields (for Guest users or for Fastlane members who don't have an accepted card in their profile)

#### Key Features
- Quickest way to integrate Fastlane
- Pre-formatted display to show Fastlane members their selected payment method
- Payment form including billing address for Guest users
- Data Security: Quick Start Integration is PCI DSS compliant, ensuring that customer payment information is handled securely

## How to run locally

```sh
npm install
```
